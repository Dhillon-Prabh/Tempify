# Tempify

Version 2.0 of the original Tempify application.

This is the 'front-end' of the application. Serves all UI components and is the 
'view' portion of our application. 

Fetches all information from our express backend by making 'fetch' function calls 
to the end-routes defined in our express server back-end. 

Initial project setup uses Create-React-App.

Start:
